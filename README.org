* Explanation
** Motivation

- Summary table processed with org-mode
- org-capture for new scores 
* Tutorial (TODO)
* How-to guide
** Install

Copy ~elfeed-score-org~ in PATH and add ~(load-file PATH)~ to your emacs
init file.

** Setup

*** Minimal setup

**** Load module

With PATH as the path where the module has been copied:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (load-file PATH)
#+end_src

*** Suggested setup

**** Add scores templates to your capture templates

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (elfeed-score-org-setup)
#+end_src

** Use

- Enter elfeed-navi
- Generate the feed list using `g'
- Navigate the list of feed titles using `n' and `p'
- Hit `RET' to enter elfeed and display the buffer `*elfeed-search*'
  filtered by the feed title selected
- When returning to elfeed-navi, regenerate the summary using `G';
  regenerating using `g' would take the current elfeed-search filter
  that include the feed-title string, producing not-meaningful
  results.
